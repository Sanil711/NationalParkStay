                                Imagine all the joy of backpacking without the burden of a heavy backpack filled with
                                tents
                                and cooking gear. That's the appeal of the Yosemite High Sierra Camps, nestled high in
                                the
                                wilderness and surrounded by nothing but nature. Accessible on foot or by mule, once
                                you're
                                here you'll be free to explore the back country—carrying only a day pack as you head out
                                each day. Camps are spaced 6 to 10 miles apart along a loop trail. If you're new to
                                wilderness travel, guided mule trips and hiking trips are available.
