                <h2 class="pHead">Forest Habitat</h2>
                <p class="p">
                    The most dominating habitat-type here is the Forest habitat. Of flowering plants alone, an estimated 1300 species exist in SGNP. Much of the forest here conforms to the southern mixed-deciduous forest, dominated by the Tectona, Albizzia, Terminalia, Holarrhena, Firmiana, Dalbergia, Garuga, Grewia, Adina, Ficus, Madhuca, Caraya, Butea and bamboo compositions. This is most evident in the lowlands and up along the hill slopes.

                <h2 class="pHead">Upper Slopes</h2>
                <p class="p">
                    On the upper slopes and in some of the secluded, narrow valleys and stream-beds, there are elements of semi-evergreen, and also some evergreen flora. The few small patches of true Asoca (Saraca asoca) are magical, dense and deep green always, so striking against the leaf-fall of the deciduous all around, the flash of a Blue Mormon butterfly, the rambling whistling of a Malabar whistling-thrush, the fluty notes of a Brown-cheeked Fulvetta.

                <p class="p">
                    Bamboo is quite widespread, especially in the lower areas, and the teak-bamboo forest community with its characteristic bird-life and general make-up is easily evident. The Karvi (Strobilanthes) is a widespread shrub that constitutes the undergrowth of vast stretches of the forest here; this abundant shrub, while visible all through, even as dry stalks during summer, is most flamboyant when it blooms once after every seven years.

                <h2 class="pHead">Mammals</h2>
                <p class="p">
                    Small herds of Spotted Deer, a solitary Sambhar, a darting Barking Deer or being surprised by a Black-naped Hare running across your path are just some of the pleasant surprises of the National Park, but nothing can really match the awe, fear and goose-pimply feeling when one is confronted by a large Leopard. The density of Leopards is one of the highest for any such wilderness, which makes this encounter a very real possibility. Sighting a Porcupine, which is rare, or a Palm civet, hardly seen these days or encountering a striped Hyena can make it a memorable experience. The lucky few can possibly see the elusive Four-horned Antelope or the extremely shy Mouse Deer. The monkey species includes the Rhesus Macaque, which is an introduced species, the Bonnet Macaque and the completely vegetarian Hanuman langur (leaf monkey). The Indian flying fox is the biggest of the 17 bat species found in the park.

                <p class="p">
                    The National Park is a bird watchers' paradise. From the tiny Tickell's Flowerpecker (small bird in India), many species of Sunbirds (old world equivalent of the humming birds) to the majestic White-bellied Sea Eagle. It is a visual feast with birds like the Paradise Flycatcher, the elusive Trogon, many species of Kingfishers, Woodpeckers, the continuous calling of the Brown-headed Barbet, the wildly screeching Parakeets, the metallic calls of the Racket-tailed Drongo, the musical call of the Tickell's Blue Flycatcher or the extremely melodious song of the Malabar Whistling Thrush or the familiar refrain of the Spotted babbler are just a few facets of nature's symphony in this forest.

                <p class="p">
                    The Reptilian world is well represented by Crocodiles in Tulsi Lake, Monitor Lizards, Pythons, Cobras, Russell's viper, Bamboo-pit Viper and the extremely rare Ceylonese Cat Snake recently discovered by the staff of Bombay National History Society. Smaller reptiles also add to the wonder of this park. The invertebrate world from Crabs to Spiders to insects, Giant wood spiders, Signature spiders, Black wood spider with their large webs in monsoon is a treat to any naturalist. The insect world shows abundant variations in the form of Silk cotton bugs, Beetles and several kinds of Mantis. The Butterfly world is represented in a fascinating range of sizes and colors and the spectacular Blue Mormon, the phenomenal artist of camouflage the Blue Oak leaf, the bright Jezebels and Large Yellow and White Orange tips, Monarchs, Egg fly, Sailors are some of the many attractive butterflies one can find here.

                <p class="p">
                    A 2,000-year-old complex sits within the park, housing more than 100 (is this correct) caves cut out of rock forming a protected archaeological site. The word 'Kanheri' is derived from Sanskrit word 'Krishnagiri', which literally means 'black mountain'. View the magnificent relics of Buddha and the Bodhisattvas and walk along the pillared corridors of the prayer halls. One can drive, walk, take a bus ride or even cycle up to here.

                <p class="p">
                    For the past three decades, 'Vanrani', a miniature toy train, has been operating in SGNP (Sanjay Gandhi National Park, formerly known as 'Krishnagiri Park'). Its name, derived from Hindi, translates to 'Jungle Queen' in English. This charming Jungle Queen toy train, which can accommodate around 20 to 25 passengers, has become one of Mumbai's oldest and most beloved tourist attractions.
                    It is actually a mini safari that takes about 15 minutes inside the Borivali National Park. The train runs on small railway tracks with limited seating capacity and covers a distance of up to 2.5 kilometers. The ride, which used to be yellow but is now green, lasts for about 15 to 20 minutes.

                    One of the most peaceful places in the entire National Park. Gandhi Tekdi offers a 360Â° view of the SGNP. Lots of people come here for walks, jogging and to do Yoga. It also offers a very nice sitting place under the dome structure at Gandhi Tekdi. Around it lies a very beautiful garden which is well maintained by authorities. During monsoon it is one of the most beautiful spots in the National Park. There is a proper road that goes all the way up to the top whereas a separate route to climb to the tekdi also exists.

                <p class="p">
                    Human beings have been always fascinated with the celestial objects. In a city like Mumbai, observing stars and planets can be a difficult task owing to cloud cover and light pollution. But Sanjay Gandhi National Park offers a unique chance to do that. To introduce visitors to the wonders of the night sky, the Nature Interpretation Center (NIC) of SGNP, often organizes star gazing sessions. With the help of powerful telescopes and knowledgeable experts, visitors can spot and learn nearby planets and get their rare chance to admire the night sky from right in the heart of Mumbai.
