                <p class="p">
                    The lowest elevations in Yosemite are found on the western boundary of the park at the El Portal
                    Administrative Site, which is at approximately 1,800 feet (549 m). This is the foothill-woodland
                    zone, an area that is hot and dry in the summer with very little or no snow in the winter.
                    Plants
                    within this zone include chamise, ceanothus, manzanita, blue oak, interior live oak, and gray
                    pine.
                    These plant communities can also be found near Hetch Hetchy reservoir.

                <p class="p">
                    Beginning near the 3,000 foot (900 m) elevation, the hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters of
                    the Mediterranean climate give rise to the lower montane forest zone. The accumulation of
                    several feet of snow during the winter is not uncommon and can stay on the ground for several
                    months.
                    The diversity of tree species found in this zone make this a beautiful and interesting forest to
                    explore. The lower montane forests are found along the western boundary of the park and include
                    trees such as California black oak, ponderosa pine, incense-cedar, and white fir.<br>
                    Yosemite's giant sequoia groves including the Mariposa, Merced, and the Tuolumne Groves are also
                    found within this vegetation zone.

                <p class="p">
                    The upper montane forest begins at higher elevations near 6,000 feet (1800 m), where the
                    montane
                    climate is characterized by short, moist, cool summers and cold, wet winters. Snow begins to
                    fall in
                    November and may accumulate to depths up to six feet and remain until June.<br>
                    Pure stands of red fir and lodgepole pine are typical of this forest. Jeffrey pine, which
                    has bark
                    that smells like vanilla, and the picturesque western juniper can also be found in this
                    zone.
                    Beautiful wildflowers bloom in meadows from June through August.

                <p class="p">
                    The upper montane forest is replaced by the subalpine forest near 8,000 feet (2450 m),
                    where the
                    climate is cooler with an even shorter growing season due to long, cold, and snowy
                    winters.
                    Accumulations of three to nine feet of snow are typical.<br>
                    The western white pine, mountain hemlock, and lodgepole pine are found in this forest
                    with many
                    subalpine meadows that flower from July through August.

                    The alpine zone of Yosemite begins near the 9,500 foot (2,900 m) elevation and is
                    easily
                    distinguished as it is above tree line. No trees grow in this zone due to the harsh
                    climatic
                    conditions. Short, cool summers with long, cold, and snowy winters are typical at
                    these
                    elevations.<br>
                    Many exposed granitic outcroppings, talus slopes, and boulder fields limit the
                    amount of vegetation
                    that grows here. The herbaceous plants need to flower and produce their seeds
                    quickly during the
                    short, frost-free period of summer.

                <p class="p">
                    There are approximately 300 to 500 black bears inside Yosemite. They continue to
                    be one of the most
                    sought after animals to see. Contrary to their name, most of the black bears in
                    Yosemite have brown
                    fur. If you see a bear while hiking, park rangers urge you to give the bear
                    space. Black bears are
                    rarely confrontational, but are known to be aggressive when they have cubs or
                    are guarding food.

                <p class="p">
                    The bighorn sheep of Yosemite are the only animals in the park on the
                    endangered species list. They
                    normally stick to the highest terrain in the park. If you are hiking in some
                    of the higher
                    elevations, you may spot one of these incredible creatures with a pair of
                    binoculars.<br>
                    Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep learn to leap from crag to crag in early
                    lambhood, developing quickly
                    into keen-eyed, strong-limbed and extremely agile creatures, always on the
                    move to escape mountain
                    lions and find food on steep, rocky slopes.

                <p class="p">
                    Mountain lions—also called cougars, pumas or panthers—roam Yosemite's
                    mountains and valleys. These
                    important predators, native to the Americas, are a natural part of the
                    Yosemite landscape. Because
                    they are shy, solitary creatures, they elude visitors and are typically
                    unconcerned by human
                    presence even in close proximity. Sightings in the park often document a
                    mountain lion on the
                    prowl—sometimes chasing, killing or eating a raccoon or coyote.

                <p class="p">
                    While hiking in Yosemite, the chances of seeing a mule deer are
                    high. Mule deer are the only type of
                    deer that call the park home. Park rangers discourage people from
                    feeding the deer because they may
                    become agitated, and human food can be harmful to them.

                    Bobcats in Yosemite are elusive animals, but they have been
                    spotted many times. It is not unusual to
                    see bobcats hunting pray during the day. They are very important
                    to the parks ecosystem because they
                    keep the rodent population under control. Humans have nothing to
                    fear from these beautiful cats.

                <p class="p">
                    No matter where you hike in Yosemite, you may catch a
                    glimpse of a coyote. Even when you are nowhere
                    near them, it is also possible to hear them howling at each
                    other to communicate. Naturalists
                    believe the Yosemite coyotes enjoy howls the way we enjoying
                    singing. Coyotes are very shy and try
                    to avoid humans. If you are hiking in Yosemite, park rangers
                    recommend taking some time to watch the
                    meadows. This is where many of the animals come to feed.
                    Wherever you go in the park, you are bound
                    to see some fascinating animals in their natural habitats.

                    and even appears on the California State quarter!<br>
                    Perched over the valley, the 4,737 feet granite crest
                    was long considered inaccessible, but now
                    offers an 8.5 mile trail to the summit, several rock
